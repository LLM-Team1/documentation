# Usecase

We want to create a SaaS solution that is aimed at business strategy analysts of a company (see personas) to support them in tasks such as competitor analysis.

In our tool, the user should be able to:

* upload their own annual report, use an existing one or a public one to gain insights into the respective company
* create a SWOT analysis for the selected report
* ask individual questions about the report via a chatbot
