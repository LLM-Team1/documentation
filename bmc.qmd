# Business Model Canvas and Use Case Identification

After Identifying our use case we build up a business model canvas (BMC) to give our start up a structure. In the
following you can see our BMC with its nine dimensions.

![Our Business Model Canvas](images/BMC.png)

Subsequently you find the dimensions of the BMC in detail with the description of that decision.

## Value Proposition
It is our main goal to provide easy and fast access to branch insights. Being more precise, we aim to give our
customers a wide overview of the market and their (direct) competitors. To achieve this goal we offer different
features in our application, including the SWOT Analysis, the BCG Matrix, a Business Model Canvas and a short profile
of the relevant competitor.
Our customers choose which competitors they would like to analyze. They simply select or upload the annual report of a
relevant competitor and start analyzing by using our features such as the SWOT Analysis.
The tool consists of many different features to analyze the annual reports. We are planning to first publish the
company profile/ summary, SWOT analysis, Business Model Canvas, and BCG Matrix, to then extend these features in the
future to give our customers even more options to analyze the annual reports.

## Customer Segments
As our customer segments we decided to be focusing on companies in the automotive industry. This industry is currently
extremely fast moving and the competition between those companies is on an all time high. One of the biggest reasons is
the development of environmentally friendly vehicles and the rising competition by brands on the Asian market. This
makes it very important for the affected companies to keep an eye on their competition and arising trends -making them
the perfect customers for our analysis tool.

More in detail, we identified strategic-competitor analysts in the automotive industry as our end users.

In the future we could extend our customer base to a variety of interesting customer segments. These customers could be
firms in the field of investors, finance analysts or business consulting.


## Customer Relationship
To build our first customer base we will step in personal contact with just a few companies in the automotive field. At
the same time we are keeping this close relationship with our customers to fully understand them and their needs to
optimize our products to serve them as efficiently as possible. We will also offer consulting to this customer segment
to adjust or extend the features of the tool to their specific needs.
Later we will make our product available to a wider range of customers and offer off the shelf software including a few
basic analysis methods. This off the shelf software is the product we want to sell to a wider range of customers. To
stay in touch we will set up an email newsletter to keep them posted on new feature releases and changes of our tool.
This customer segment can then use our self-service to unlock these new features.


## Channels
Depending on the product we would either choose online marketing or direct sales. In case of the "off the shelf"
software with no additional features we target the broader mass; meaning we are trying to reach as many customers
with the same product. For our customer specific products, tailored to a more specific need on the customer side, we
approach companies in a more direct sales kind of style. We expect to make more money per sale on the customer specific
software, since we price the specifications and consulting services. That allows us to use this more expensive way of
customer channel.

## Key partners
As our key partners we identified providers of corporate and financial data. In the beginning we will simply use the
public annual reports of well known companies and let our customers upload their own data to our application. In the
future we want to extend this function to also offer exclusive corporate and financial data on our application. This
data will be brought in by the mentioned provider firms.

Another important partner is a marketing agency with experience in this field. With this partner we can get automotive
companies to know us and our services.

Facing the challenge of the groundedness and quality of the data provided by us we need auditing firms to ensure high
quality of the data provided by our application.


## Key activities
One of our most important activities is software development. Especially in the beginning it is key to improve and
extend the features of our product. Starting with our main feature, the SWOT matrix, we need to introduce more features
and more ways to analyze the competition and market.
Also the maintenance and updating of the database is a key activity.
Another important activity is customer support. We want to help our customers with their problems -making it easy to
reach out to us, which makes it easier for us to understand our customer needs, improve the product, and finally make
our customers happy.


## Key resources
The most important Resource in our startup is the software developers. They ensure the quality and functionality of
our product. Additional to that we need the hardware for our employees.

## Cost structure
Our Cost structure mainly consists of  fixed cost for employee salaries for product development, maintenance, and
consulting services. We also need to pay licenses for the commercial use of (development) software as fixed costs. At
the same time we need to attract new customers, resulting in marketing expenses. For variable costs we pay for every API
calls to OpenAI, made by our customers.

## Revenue streams

For our SaaS business model, our revenue stream is structured around several key components. Firstly, we offer
licensing of our software tool, allowing customers to gain access to our platform and its basic functionalities.
Secondly, we provide subscription-based access to our SaaS solution, offering different tiers or plans that unlock
additional features and capabilities based on the customer's needs and usage requirements. This subscription model
ensures recurring revenue as customers continue to utilize our platform over time.

In addition to subscriptions, we offer maintenance and support services to ensure that our customers receive ongoing
assistance, updates, and troubleshooting to keep their software running smoothly. This component not only enhances
customer satisfaction but also provides an additional revenue stream through service contracts or subscription add-ons.

Moreover, we differentiate ourselves by offering consulting services to tailor our software to the specific needs and
requirements of our customers. Our team of experts works closely with clients to understand their business processes,
customize the software accordingly, and provide training and guidance for optimal utilization. These consulting
services serve as a valuable revenue stream, allowing us to provide personalized solutions while generating additional
income beyond the software subscription fees.

Overall, our revenue stream encompasses a combination of software licensing, subscription-based access, maintenance and
support services, and consulting offerings, providing a comprehensive and sustainable approach to monetizing our SaaS
business model.
