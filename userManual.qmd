Through the dropdown-menu you can select a report from the uploaded reports. 
If you have already created a SWOT analysis for the selected report it will be fetched automatically from the database. Then you can see the summary first for each category: 
![Data Model of StratMystiqPro](images/Swot2.png){width=100% .lightbox}
If you then click into one of the four categories you will get a full description for every given point:

For this you can select two different reports in the drop-down menus. 
The same principle applies here as for the SWOT analysis. If you already created a Comparison-SWOT it will be fetched automatically after you selected the corresponding reports. The differences in each category will be listed in summary version first.
