    "text": "In this module we got the task to identify a use case from a business model canvas to improve a business unit or different part of an existing company.\nTogether with Mr. Kirenz we decided to first define our use case to then create a business model from there on. Our use case was based on the idea of finding a way to make business analysis quick and easy for a wide range of potential customers. After that we constructed the business model around this use case. You can read more about the use case identification and modelling of our Business Model Canvas here. For a more visual understanding of our startups’ next goals we created a strategy map showing the directions our start up would go in the future.\nOur solution takes the findings of our use case identification and transform them into a software as a service (SaaS) solution. This solution provides an analysis tool for our customers to fulfill our value propositions.\nWe are using a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to load and retrieve the needed information (coming from business reports) in/from our vector store. We encountered different obstacles on our way, therefore we decided to customize the basic RAG pipline to deal with image/ table recognition and at the same time improve answer precision by using a multi query approach.\nWe used multiple evaluation methods to evaluate the performance of our customized RAG. The main goal was here to identify the overall performance of our custom RAG compared to the basic RAG. At the same time we evaluated the best chunk size for both RAGs. The best solution was our custom RAG, using the chunk size of 900.\nWe also developed a user friendly frontend to enable our customers to navigate between their business reports, analyses, and comparisons. Focus here was especially on the presentation of the extensive information in the SWAT analyses.\nFinally we created a comprehensive manual on how to deploy our application and how to use our application.",

    "text": "Fundamental Goals of Evaluation\n\n\nMethods for RAG-Evaluation\nThere are different options when it comes to evaluating a RAG-System. After looking into the literature we found different out that there is not the one perfect method to evaluate a RAG-System.\nIn Information Retrieval (IR) Venable et al. (2016) looks at the whole development process of an IR System. In the following Figure XX we see different approaches for different products. Our product falls in the “Human Risk & Effectiveness” path. This path is made for solutions that are human centered just as our system. The black triangles are symbolizing different possible evaluation steps. On the y axis we find a scale coming from artificial, going to more naturalistic. Artificial stands for a more automated evaluation process. On the other hand we find a scale from formative to summative on the x axis. Formative means that with this evaluation we try to improve the output; while summative evaluations should give an more generall overview over the final product and whether it is providing all the functionalities it should provide as a solution a customer could use.\nSince our product is still in the prototype phase we concentrated our evaluation on the first three triangles. Meaning we did an automated evaluation using libraries like TruLens and RAGAS. The biggest advantage coming with these techniques is that they are comparably cheap (Venable et al., 2016). Next we used human evaluation to prove the results of our automated evaluation approach with this human centered approach. Human centered approaches for evaluation bring the advantage to give a more realistic view on the system. Problem with these approaches is that they are comparably expensive and time consuming (Venable et al., 2016)\n\n\nGeneral Evaluation Foundation\nWe used our evaluation methods always on both, the basic RAG and our customized RAG. To do so we handed over the following eight questions. On the one hand question 1,2,3,5 are more “simple” questions, aiming to find a simple answer. Question 4,6,7,8 on the other hand are more “complex” questions, aiming to find a solution, where multiple contexts are needed from the business report.\nPrompts to RAG in evaluation process:\n\nWhat product categories and car models does Mercedes-Benz offer?\nWhat was the total revenue of Mercedes-Benz in the last fiscal year?\nWhich new markets did Mercedes-Benz enter in the past year?\nWhat specific sustainability goals has Mercedes-Benz set for the upcoming year?\nHow much did Mercedes-Benz invest in research and development in the last fiscal year?\nWhat are the key challenges Mercedes-Benz has faced in its supply chain and production processes, and how have these impacted its operational efficiency?\nHow is Mercedes-Benz adapting its overall business strategy to align with current global automotive trends, such as digitalization, sustainability, and changing consumer preferences? 8.What opportunities does Mercedes-Benz have in the realm of electric vehicles and autonomous driving technologies, and what strategic initiatives are they undertaking in these areas?\n\n\n\nAutomated Evaluation Approach\nAs already mentioned we used different libraries to evaluate our RAG-System.\nFinally we ended up using the RAGAS framework since this made it easy to extract the evaluation results in an excel file to later compare it with our human centered evaluation approach. Following you we see the results of our evaluation using the RAGAS framework.\n\n\nHuman Centered Evaluation Approach",
