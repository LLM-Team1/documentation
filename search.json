    "text": "In this module we got the task to identify a use case from a business model canvas to improve a business unit or different part of an existing company.\nTogether with Mr. Kirenz we decided to first define our use case to then create a business model from there on. Our use case was based on the idea of finding a way to make business analysis quick and easy for a wide range of potential customers. After that we constructed the business model around this use case. You can read more about the use case identification and modelling of our Business Model Canvas here. For a more visual understanding of our startups’ next goals we created a strategy map showing the directions our start up would go in the future.\nOur solution takes the findings of our use case identification and transform them into a software as a service (SaaS) solution. This solution provides an analysis tool for our customers to fulfill our value propositions.\nWe are using a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to load and retrieve the needed information (coming from business reports) in/from our vector store. We encountered different obstacles on our way, therefore we decided to customize the basic RAG pipline to deal with image/ table recognition and at the same time improve answer precision by using a multi query approach.\nWe used multiple evaluation methods to evaluate the performance of our customized RAG. The main goal was here to identify the overall performance of our custom RAG compared to the basic RAG. At the same time we evaluated the best chunk size for both RAGs. The best solution was our custom RAG, using the chunk size of 900.\nWe also developed a user friendly frontend to enable our customers to navigate between their business reports, analyses, and comparisons. Focus here was especially on the presentation of the extensive information in the SWAT analyses.\nFinally we created a comprehensive manual on how to deploy our application and how to use our application.",

Being more precise, we aim to give our customers a wide overview of the market and their (direct) competitors. To achieve this goal we offer different features in our application, including the SWOT Analysis, the BCG Matrix, a Business Model Canvas and a short profile of the relevant competitor. Our customers choose which competitors they would like to analyze. They simply select or upload the annual report of a relevant competitor and start analyzing by using our features such as the SWOT Analysis. The tool consists of many different features to analyze the annual reports. We are planning to first publish the company profile/ summary, SWOT analysis, Business Model Canvas, and BCG Matrix, to then extend these features in the future to give our customers even more options to analyze the annual reports.",
