# Frontend Documentation
StratMystiqPro has a user-friendly frontend that was developed using the React web framework.
In this section of the documentation, we will describe it in detail.

## Overview of the frontend functionalities:
- **Login and access to backend functions:**
    - Registered users have the opportunity to use all functions of our backend. These include uploading annual reports and interacting with the RAG pipeline.

- **Annual report processing:**
    - Once an annual report has been uploaded, it is sent to our backend. There it passes through the RAG pipeline as described on the Page [RAG pipeline](../RAGpipeline.qmd).
    - In the second step, the processed report can be used to create a SWOT analysis in the frontend.

- **SWOT analysis generation:**
    - Users can generate and display a SWOT analysis in the frontend.
    - The basis for this is the processed annual report from the backend.

- **Comparison of annual reports:**
    - In addition to the individual analysis, our system offers the option of comparing analyses of two annual reports.
    - Users can view the results of these comparisons in the front end.

- **Chatbot support:**
    - We have implemented a chatbot that allows users to ask self-formulated questions about a selected annual report.
    - The chatbot offers an interactive way of requesting information and makes it easier to navigate the system.
