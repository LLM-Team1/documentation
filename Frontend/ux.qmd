# User experience
We have developed a logical user guidance for our frontend, in which the user is guided step by step through the process
from uploading the PDF with the annual report to creating and viewing the finished SWOT analysis. (More in the [User Guide](../userManual.html))

Overall, we have taken a minimalist approach to the design of the frontend.
This means that we have made sure that we only have the most important elements on one page and arrange the individual elements in a recurring layout.
Accordingly, the content of our pages is always centered and all text is left-aligned. For orientation,
the navigation bar is always displayed at the top of the screen with the currently selected page highlighted. We also use only a few colors and a few gradations of them.
Specifically, this is a dark blue as the background color, a lighter blue as the primary color, as well as gradations of it for all our elements and orange as an accent color,
which we use for the buttons. We decided to use a dark background and a small number of colors to create a coherent and harmonious look and not distract the user from the content.
We created this color combination using an online tool for creating color parallels and then adjusted it slightly.
In addition, for reasons of readability and aesthetics, we use a shade of white as the text color to avoid too much contrast between the background and the text,
which could otherwise lead to visual fatigue. [@Albert2016, pg. 60]

We have also deliberately decided to use rounded corners everywhere to create a softer look.
In addition, all clickable elements are provided with a zoom effect or have a highlighted background as soon as you hover
over them with the mouse so that they are even easier to recognize as such.

For reasons of accessibility, we have also made sure that the onClick functions are not placed on elements other than buttons,
which also allows people with operating aids, such as a screen reader, to localize clickable elements.

To make it easier for users to use our tool and avoid unnecessary click paths, we automatically load the most recent analysis created by
the user on the SWOT page when a report is selected, if one already exists. If no analysis has yet been created, we display a corresponding message at the
top right of the screen to inform users that they must first create one.
We also display such messages if the login has failed and if a new analysis is currently being generated, as this process takes some time.

During the upload and processing of a report, the progress is indicated by a loading bar.
While the processing is running, the upload button is grayed out so that another report cannot be uploaded in the meantime.
