# Component description
As is typical for React, we have built components for all our elements that we can reuse modularly elsewhere.
We first planned and designed these components in Figma and then implemented them.
One example of this is the complete SWOT matrix, which is used on both the SWOT page and the comparison page.
The same applies to the button component, which we use wherever the orange button is required. The two tables on the My Reports page are also based on the same component.
This division of the individual elements into components makes it easier for us to assemble new elements from them without having to rebuild the respective components each time.
All of them also have interfaces for adjusting individual parameters, such as color, text or, of course, if they display dynamic data from the database, a way to read it in.
From a development point of view, a granular division into components makes sense above all if they can be reused in other elements and
therefore do not have to be developed anew for each element. Above all, this saves time and also avoids malfunctions,
as you don't have to write functionally identical or similar code multiple times.
You also don't have to make sure that you implement the same design every time, as this is already specified by the component.

When styling the components, we consistently developed and implemented a design adapted for smaller screens in addition to the normal design for large screens.
The frontend was developed desktop first, i.e. we focused primarily on large screen sizes and only adapted the existing design for small screens in a second step.
By individually adapting the components to the mobile design only when the available space makes it necessary,
we have a seamless responsiveness that works on practically all common screen sizes.
