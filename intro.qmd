# Introduction

In this module we got the task to identify a use case from a business model canvas to improve a business unit or
different part of an existing company.

For us there was the use case first. We wanted to find a way to make business analysis quick and easy. Therefore we
constructed the business model around our use case. You can read more about the use case identification and modelling
of our Business Model Canvas [here](https://llm-team1.github.io/documentation/bmc.html).
