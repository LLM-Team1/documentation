Setup for Local Development
To set up the backend for local development:

Ensure you have Python 3.11 or later installed.
Install the required dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt.
Ensure the MySQL and Chroma databases are running. These can be started using Docker Compose with the command docker-compose up mysql chromadb.
Run the application with python main.py.
The main.py script takes care of setting up the application. It creates the database tables if they don't exist.
